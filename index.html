            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hi, my name is Raphael Julian Manalo. I am currently a 22 year old student at RMIT, studying an
                Associate's Degree in Information Technology.
                <br>I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. I am of Filipino ethnicity, with both of my
                parents being born in the Philippines.
                <br>In my free time I enjoy playing games, watching movies, going to the gym and spending time
                with friends.
            </p>

            <p>Other facts about me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am 5'7".</li>

                <li>I LOVE food, some of my favourites being Beef Tartare, Pork Gyoza, Tuna Sashimi, and Banh Mi.

            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p>While minor details change in my head depending on the day, the general ideas are ultimately the
                same. I would like to pursue a career in the software side of the business/corporate landscape,
                whether that's in data science, information systems, predictive analytics or any software
                department for matter. <br> I feel as if the business field would allow for the work that is
                done, to be presented and ultilised in a more meaningful and practical manner. I feel like the
                more hands-on nature of working for a client in a team enviroment would be the best use of my
                skills and abilities. Plus big business = big money (just in exchange for your soul but that's
                no biggie). </p>
